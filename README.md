Hi, just a place for me to show my work and let people witness how great of an programmer, 3d/2d artist I am. jk

2d Assets folder is where I dump all my scribbles at. Theres also a unity build for windows with a simple demo on how they look in engine.

Projects folder is where I upload my unity projects, for more details about the project look through the README file there. (1/3 uploaded so far).
