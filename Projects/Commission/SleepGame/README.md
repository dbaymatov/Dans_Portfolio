Hi

This project was comisioned by WellnessToolbox, an organisation that focuses on the rehabilitation on mental support for its patients.
The purpose of this project is to pick the most appropriate advice to the user at improving there sleep, through playing the game.
I was tasked with creating the coding architecture and assisting at integration of the project into the clients website and connecting it to the database.
The project presented here does not feature the integration aspects due to clients request.
