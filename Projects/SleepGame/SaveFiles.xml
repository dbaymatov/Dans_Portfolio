          <goodAnswer>Great! Struggling to fall asleep just leads to frustration. If you’re not asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room, and do something relaxing, like reading or listening to music until you are tired enough to sleep.</goodAnswer>

          <badAnswer>Worrying about whether you’re getting enough sleep only makes it harder to sleep. Try turning clock faces away from your bed and placing electronic devices out of reach. Rather than trying to “fall asleep” just aim to be restful.</badAnswer>
